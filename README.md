# Urban Routes

**Project Overview:**

Urban Routes is an application designed to create routes, determining travel time and expenses across various modes of transportation.

The application underwent thorough manual QA testing, with Chrome DevTools playing a crucial role. JIRA and Google Workspace were indispensable tools for analyzing and designing test cases during the manual testing phase.

**Your Role and Contributions:**

In my role as a QA engineer, my responsibilities included:
- Formulating test cases by employing thorough analysis and design, utilizing black-box testing techniques
- Validating data input through the web application's forms
- Employing Chrome DevTools to scrutinize HTTP responses and, if needed, override specific responses to test new features.

**Project Deliverables:**

A document focusing on the breakdown of the requirements into test conditions and a list of test cases done to validate form input can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NXW3oTlJ3Sam4GZrt_dzkENficCDbd_q?usp=drive_link).

Meanwhile, the document with the test conditions and a spreadsheet of test cases for adding a payment method and a new transportation mode can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H2dqaO3UWEjiYcm5Nna1nRgFKYj_Or9e?usp=drive_link)

**Testing Approach:**

Functional system testing was heavily carried out. This testing approach was highly dependent on the test cases created.
The test cases were developed using black-box testing techniques, especially equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis.
Both positive and negative scenarios were considered and tested.

**List of Tests Conducted:**

A comprehensive list of tests can be found in the aforementioned deliverables.

**Test Results:**

The total number of test cases done is 88. Out of 88, 54.5% of tests had passed (48), while 45.5% of tests had failed (40).
